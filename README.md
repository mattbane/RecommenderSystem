RecommenderSystem
=================

Recommender systems make suggestions for users based on the similarity of their preferences to the similarity of other users preferences.  Using the movielens 100k user data set from the grouplens.org website the following code allows a user rate a selection of movies on a scale from 1 - 5 and based on those ratings produce the top 10 recommended movies.
